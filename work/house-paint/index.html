                        Zippy Creative, our game development studio, received a client project for a mid-core casual game called "House Paint." 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project was led by Shailja Shrivastava, the founder and senior developer. As a intern programmer at the studio, I was tasked with creating a shop system for the game.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w4">
                    <h3>The Task</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w6">
                    
                    <p>
                        In the first month, I worked on the basic shop system, while other team members focused on developing gameplay mechanics. The next month, I focused on polishing the entire game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And after that I developed the shop and redemption systems further and would integrate seamlessly. Subsequently, I worked closely with Shailja to integrate several custom SDKs for analytics, a redemption system, and other custom events as required by client.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w4">
                    <h3>Action</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w6">
                    
                    <p>
                        Over the course of the nine-month project, I quickly demonstrated my high-level programming skills and ability to understand the underlying functionality of various software development kits (SDKs). With this  developed a shop and redemption system that allowed players to redeem money into their PayPal account or receive Robux. </p>
                        <p>Throughout the project, I became extremely skilled in building iOS games using Unity and Xcode, as development required continuous test builds. I also excelled at working closely with the team and collaborating with the founder, Shilaja, to ensure that the shop and redemption systems were integrated into the game seamlessly.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="column-w4">
                    <h3>Result</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w6">
                    
                    <p>
                        Over the nine-month project, I not only demonstrated my high-level programming skills and ability to develop systems for games, but I also became an essential team member. Resulting in my transition from an intern to a full-time Jr. Programmer.
                    </p>
                    <p> My contributions played a vital role in ensuring the success of the "House Paint" game. The project ultimately showcased my talents in programming, game development, and iOS development, and provided me with a unique opportunity to hone my skills in a professional setting.</p>
