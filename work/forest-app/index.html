                    <h3>Situation</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w6">
                    
                    <p>As a productivity enthusiast and avid user of Pomodoro apps, I noticed a gap in the market for an app that caters to the specific interests of banana enthusiasts. Inspired by my love for bananas, I decided to create a Pomodoro timer app with a delightful banana theme, custom timing, and the option to listen to White Noise (Rainforest BGM).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w4">
                    <h3>The Task</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w6">
                    
                    <p>
                        My goal was to create a Pomodoro timer app that would resonate with banana enthusiasts and provide them with a fun and engaging way to stay focused. The app would feature a growing banana plant indicator to add a playful touch to the experience, along with custom timing and White Noise (Rainforest BGM). Additionally, I integrated interstitial and banner ads to the app to monetize it effectively.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w4">
                    <h3>Action</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w6">
                    
                    <p>
                        Using my expertise in Unity and C#, I developed a UI system that seamlessly integrated with the engine to create an app that was both user-friendly and fun. I successfully created a growing banana indicator, and users could set custom timers, listen to White Noise (Rainforest BGM), and track their focus time. Additionally, I successfully integrated interstitial and banner ads to the app to monetize it effectively.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="column-w4">
                    <h3>Result</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="column-w6">
                    
                    <p>
                        Although the app did not receive the number of downloads or generate the revenue I had hoped for, it was a fun endeavor that I'm proud of. Forest but Banana provided a unique and engaging experience. The growing banana indicator added a playful twist to the app, deriving from Forest, and the focus tracking system helped users stay on track. Although insuccesful, it was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to hone my app development skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, I would like to point that, this app served lifted the fear for being a game programmer is a limitation to app development. A programmer's tools, are just tools, I can craft whatever I wish to.</p>
